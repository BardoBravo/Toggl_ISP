tasks

Adjust GITHUB - dONE

Simple process

First login:
a) create a new workplace (ISP) [possible issue with generated ID - how to store it???]
b) get all tasks available from ISP (SAP)
c) create corresponding projects, named after task description (i.e. Maintenance CA TAKT 12)

These are the only elements that should be created in Toggl, at first...

*** Once user has performed his first login (Bridge, after app installation), he can register hours in the Toggl ISP ***

Extract data and register to ISP:
*** Now a better knwoledge about ISP time recording is needed ***
a) read data from a specific period (start with day, then move on for week?)
b) store entry in ISP - remember that comment about knowledge????
